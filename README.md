The most difficult part of the entire project that involved many references and corrections utilizing Stackoverflow and ChatGPT; making sure that getters/setters as well as the phonetics of lines were correct proved to be more difficult than I'd previously assumed. Making sure to understand and use new tools that I'd researched or refreshing on ones I'd forgotten was something needed in order to finish this class as it was the one that gave me the most trouble.

The FileManager which also proved to be a difficult aspect of this project, seemingly endless errors at the time of creation that were ironed out and sorted time and time again. Althought admittedly it looks nothing like my inital notes had; the final project functions properly and I believe that as long as I maintained functionality it isn't too shabby for a first project.
